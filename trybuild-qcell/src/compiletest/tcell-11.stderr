  = help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `Cell<i32>`
  = note: if you want to do aliasing and mutation between multiple threads, use `std::sync::RwLock` or `std::sync::atomic::AtomicI32` instead
  = note: required for `TCell<Marker, Cell<i32>>` to implement `Sync`
note: required by a bound in `is_sync`
