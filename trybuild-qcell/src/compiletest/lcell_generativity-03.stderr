   | `tag` dropped here while still borrowed
   | borrow might be used here, when `_guard` is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `main::make_guard`
   |
   = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
   = note: this error originates in the macro `make_guard` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
